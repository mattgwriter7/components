# NOTES 
This is a place for stuff that doesn't fit under README

## NAMING CONVENTIONS
* variables be "lowercase_with_hyphens"
* methods be "camelCased()"...
* programming classes will be capitalized, and always have the filename exactly match
  + css classes will be "lowercase_with_hyphens"
  the class name (so the "Config" class is "Config.dart", for instance)
* REALLY_IMPORTANT varibles will be all caps and underscored
   + but there should only be 1 or 2 "really important" variables in the app

## IDEAS
JAVASCRIPT
Should I have little Javascript "utilities"? (with CSS hooks)
* like "open panels"
* position elements 
  + class="rel" or class="abs" looks for "data-xy" to position
* phone number / email obfuscator?
