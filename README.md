# Components Version 1N
This is the starter HTML/CSS code for my projects.

## How It Works
"Components" is a single page website made up of... components!  My  goal is to have a repository with very clean code that I can re-use as a starting point for my websites and webapps.  

This project is 99% HTML/CSS, and 1% JavaScript.

See [NOTES](https://github.com/mattgwriter7/components/blob/main/NOTES.md) for some "Plain English" information.  

Run this [DEMO](https://mattgwriter7.com/assets/demos/html_components/) to see this code in action.  

These components were what I used to make my portfolio site here:
