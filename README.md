# components
This is the starter HTML/CSS code for my projects

There are two markdown files:  
* README.md is for where we left off at, and what to do next.  
  This should be short and concise!
* NOTES.md is for longer stuff (often mentioned in this README)...

## LEFT OFF
* added first js, tidied footer

## NEXT STEPS
* panels?
